      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <section>
	<h3 class="resource">Books</h3>
	<p>There are a wide variety of machine-learning books available, some of which are available for free online.  The following books all have a Bayesian slant to them:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><em>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</em> (PRML) by <span class="author">Christopher M. Bishop.</span>  Covers many machine-learning topics thoroughly.  Definite Bayesian focus.  Can also be very mathematical and take some effort to read.</li>
	  <li><em>Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</em> (BRML) by <span class="author">David Barber.</span>  Geared (as much as a machine-learning book can be!) towards computer scientists.  Lots of material on graphical models.  <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.barber/brml/">Freely available online.</a></li>
	  <li><em>Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</em> (GPML) by <span class="author">Carl Rasmussen and Christopher Williams.</span>  Excellent reference for Gaussian processes. <a href="http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/">Freely available online.</a></li>
	  <li><em>Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms</em> by <span class="author">David J. C. Mackay.</span> Very strong focus on information theory.  If you have a background in physics or are interested in information theory, this is the book for you.  <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html">Freely available online.</a></li>
	</ul>
	<section>
	  <h3 class="resource">Websites</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>I will post the source for lecture notes, demo code, etc. <a href="https://github.com/rmgarnett/cse515t">on this GitHub page.</a>  Even the source for the syllabus and this website are there.</li>
	    <li>I have created <a href="https://piazza.com/wustl/spring2015/cse515t/home/">a Piazza message board for this class.</a>  Please post any questions about the homework, etc. to the message board!  Chances are that someone else has the same question and we can all benefit from a public discussion.  If you have a question just for me and/or me and the TA, please also post this to Piazza rather than emailing us directly; you should be able to mark your message appropriately to keep it private.</li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/bayesian_machine_learning">Metacademy's roadmap to Bayesian machine learning.</a>  This is a great resource for finding additional materials related to essentially every subject we will cover in this course.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course</a> is a freely available series of video lectures providing an introduction to machine learning presented by a world-class researcher.</li>
	  </ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h3 class="resource">Datasets</h3>
	  <p>I will continue to update this list as the course progresses.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/">This website</a> has a fantastic compilation of 100 interesting, relevant datasets from all sorts of application areas.</li>
